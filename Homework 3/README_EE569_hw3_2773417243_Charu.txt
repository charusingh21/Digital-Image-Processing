    CONSOLE APPLICATION : [Warping] Project Overview
========================================================================

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your [Warping]] application.

Steps:

1. Open Warping.cpp.
	This is the main program for the algorithm.
2. All the header files and the source files have already been included in the project. 
3. Run the program and follow the instructions. 
4. Build the binary for the cpp using following commands:
    g++ -std=c++11 warping.cpp
    ./a.out
5. output will be saved as warped_raccoon.raw
6. output will be saved as unwarped_raccoon.raw
7. For hedwig and bb8 just change the input image .
