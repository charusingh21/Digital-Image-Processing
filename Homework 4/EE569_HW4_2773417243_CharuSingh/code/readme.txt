    CONSOLE APPLICATION : [Texture Classification-Train] Project Overview
========================================================================

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your [Texture Classification-Train]] application.

Steps:

1. Open index.cpp.
	This is the main program for the algorithm.
2. All the header files and the source files have already been included in the project. 
3. Change the path of image folder at line number 105. Give the absolute path of the image directory.
4. Run the program and follow the instructions. 
5. Build the binary for the cpp using following commands:
    g++ -std=c++11 index.cpp
    ./a.out
6. output will be saved as result.txt
